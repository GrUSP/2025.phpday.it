        talk_description: "Manually testing your own API endpoints using PostMan or an equivalent tool takes a lot of time. Testing them through unit tests will only test a part of our application, and often skips network and framework configuration.
        Using Behat, we can write tests in Gherkin and execute these on an actual webserver and database.
        After attending this talk, I hope that attendees will be able to:
        <ul>
        - Implement Behat into their own projects.
        - Write functional tests in Gherkin.
        - Setup state for these tests.
        - Verify test results from response bodies and database state.

This hands-on session provides a brief introduction to Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) before diving straight into practical application: We will generate an SBOM for a PHP application container! While doing so, we'll recursively create SBOMs for our dependencies, merge multiple SBOMs, and review the final results.
        This session focuses on practical learning, showcasing a variety of tools in action to equip attendees with actionable skills for real-world projects."

In this talk, we‚Äôll explore how SSR is evolving in the PHP ecosystem, focusing on practical tools like Laravel Livewire and Symfony UX. We‚Äôll dive into real-world examples to show how you can build dynamic, reactive interfaces while leveraging PHP's strengths. Discover the benefits, trade-offs, and ideal use cases of this approach to craft applications that are fast, maintainable, and delightful to use‚Äîall without a full client-side framework. Whether you're a Laravel or Symfony enthusiast, or simply curious about modern SSR techniques, this talk will provide valuable insights for your next project."

This talk looks at its past, examines its present challenges, and projects its future evolution. We will go through its birth and divergence, its 'Golden Age' of 'Open Source by default', the challenges posed by the Cloud, and the current present situation. In conclusion, we will try to predict the next decade. What will replace Open Source?"
